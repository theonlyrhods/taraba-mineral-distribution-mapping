# Taraba State Mineral Distribution Mapping (Vector GIS Project)

## Project Overview

This project presents the digitization and thematic mapping of mineral resources across Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Taraba State, Nigeria.

The objective was to convert existing mineral distribution information into a structured geospatial dataset and produce a clear thematic map using ArcGIS.

---

## Study Area

- Location: Taraba State, Nigeria
- Administrative Units: Local Government Areas (LGAs)

Software Used:
- ArcGIS 10.2.2

---

## Data Preparation

- A base map of Taraba State was obtained.
- The map was georeferenced in ArcGIS.
- LGA boundaries were digitized to create vector polygon features.
- Attribute fields were created to store mineral type information for each LGA.

---

## Vectorization Workflow

1. Georeferencing of the source map.
2. Creation of polygon feature class for LGAs.
3. Manual digitization of LGA boundaries.
4. Creation of attribute table fields.
5. Entry of mineral occurrence data per LGA.
6. Thematic symbology applied to represent mineral distribution.
7. Final cartographic layout exported.

## Map Output

The final map includes:

- Digitized LGA boundaries
- Mineral distribution per LGA
- Legend and cartographic elements
- Proper labeling and layout design

(Map outputs available in the /maps folder.)

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Georeferencing
- Vector digitization
- Attribute data structuring
- Thematic mapping
- Spatial data organization
- Cartographic layout design
- GIS data modeling concepts

## Project Significance

This project demonstrates the ability to transform non-digital mineral information into a structured GIS dataset suitable for visualization and spatial analysis. It reflects applied vector-based GIS workflow skills relevant to mineral resource mapping.
